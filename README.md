# Follow-up events to the ["FAIR Data and Software"-workshop](https://tibhannover.github.io/2018-07-09-FAIR-Data-and-Software/) at [TIB, Hannover](https://www.tib.eu)

We meet every **Wednesday** at **16 to 18 o'clock** in the
[**Grunwald-Haus**, ground floor, right besides the entrance](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/27870998)
(you may need to knock on the window). We'll be learning from each other and teaching ourselves about:

- the [FAIR Data Principles]
- sustainable software development
- in the context of scientific research, and
- establish a local [Software], [Data] and [Library] [Carpentries] group.

Anyone is welcome: students, university or library personnel, research scientists, etc.

## Process for suggesting & announcing events

1. Search the [issue list] whether your topic was presented already.
1. If not, or your idea is significantly different, please [create a new issue through the event template][add].
1. The event issue will be voted upon by interested people and we'll sort it into the schedule once someone volunteers to lead it (please indicate, if you do), and it has accumulated some :+1: votes.

#### PS: We are using [Mozilla's Study Group template for this website. They have a `ReadMe`][MSG-ReadMe]!
