# Follow-up events to the ["FAIR Data and Software"-workshop](https://tibhannover.github.io/2018-07-09-FAIR-Data-and-Software/) at [TIB, Hannover](https://www.tib.eu)

We'll be learning from each other and teaching ourselves about:

Anyone is welcome: students, university or library personnel, research scientists, etc.
